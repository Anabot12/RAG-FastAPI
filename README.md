# RAG-FastAPI

## Introduction
This project implements a lightweight FastAPI server for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The server utilizes ChromaDBâ€™s persistent client for ingesting and querying documents (PDF, DOC, DOCX, TXT) and leverages the `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for generating embeddings from the documents and queries. The server provides non-blocking API endpoints to ensure efficient concurrency handling.

The goal of this project is to upload and query documents in a seamless and efficient manner using FastAPI and ChromaDB, enabling document-based queries and retrieval of relevant content using embeddings.
